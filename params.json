{"name":"Team Admiral Dolphin","tagline":"GovHack 2013 Tasmania","body":"![Marvellous Ultimate Appliances logo](http://secretlab.com.au/gh-640.png)\r\n\r\nThe team page for Team Admiral Dolphin from GovHack 2013. Team Admiral Dolphin is based in Hobart, Tasmania.\r\n\r\n![Team](http://www.secretlab.com.au/team.jpg)\r\n\r\n# Summary\r\nMarvellous Ultimate Appliance is an electronic card game designed to help raise awareness of the energy consumed by common household appliances. \r\n\r\n# Overview\r\nMarvellous Ultimate Appliance is an electronic card game designed to help raise awareness of the energy consumed by common household appliances. Drawing on the data provided by the E3 Program (http://www.energyrating.gov.au), the game is inspired by popular battle card games such as “Magic: The Gathering”; the data is used to provide stats for cards representing each appliance in the E3 Program database. \r\n\r\nThe key pieces of data used are the energy star rating, capacity, and running cost (derived from the kWh consumption per year). The project was conceived by the team after exploring the available datasets as a way of making people more aware of the power consumption, energy usage, and cost-to-capacity implications of typical consumer appliances. The game is styled as a battle of appliances between neighbours, competing to spend their money on the most largest, most efficient, and effective appliances. The dataset used was intriguing, because whilst extremely interesting, it was not presented in a way that made the team compelled to understand it, or make use of the knowledge it gave them. \r\n\r\nThe project presents components of the data in entertaining and highly compelling ways, with the hope that this vivid presentation would inspire players of the game to learn and understand about their appliances, and how they impact energy usage and its flow-on effects.\r\n\r\n# Team \r\nThe team is made up of game designers, programmers, mathematicians, musicians, old-school UNIX users, artists, and data wranglers. The whole team are, or have been, students or staff at the University of Tasmania.\r\n\r\n* **Data Wrangler**: [Frank Sainsbury](http://twitter.com/fsainsbu) – beardless UNIX-beard.\r\n* **Game Designer**: [Tim Nugent](http://twitter.com/the_mcjones) – game designer, PhD candidate at UTAS, mobile developer.\r\n* **Software Engineer**: [Jon Manning](http://twitter.com/desplesda) – game designer, mobile developer, PhD candidate at UTAS, author for O'Reilly Media, co-founder of Secret Lab.\r\n* **Game Designer**: [Nic Wittison](http://twitter.com/nicwinton) – game designer, gamer, mobile developer.\r\n* **Game Designer**, **Data Wrangler**: [Matthew D'Orazio](http://twitter.com/ltgamer) – game designer, developer, breaker of technology.\r\n* **Visual Designer**: [Rex Smeal](http://twitter.com/rexsmeal) – artist, animator, cartoonist, developer.\r\n* **Data Wrangler**, **Composer**: [Josh Deprez](http://twitter.com/mrjosh9000) – mathematician, developer, musician.\r\n* **Visual Designer**, **Game Designer**: [Eloise Macdonald-Meyer](http://twitter.com/ducky_tape) – farming usurer. \r\n* **Producer**: [Paris Buttfield-Addison](http://twitter.com/parisba) – game designer, mobile developer, PhD candidate at UTAS, author for O'Reilly Media, co-founder of Secret Lab.\r\n* **Data Wrangler**: [Sebastian Cook](http://twitter.com/tsuite) – game designer, developer.\r\n\r\n# Technical Overview\r\nThe game was developed using a combination of C# and JavaScript (both compiled through the Mono development environment) in the Unity game engine. The game runs on the web, through the Unity browser plugin, as well as natively on Mac, Windows, and Linux. That said, the game was designed in the spirit of tablet computers such as the iPad; in future development, the team plans to polish the game and deploy it to the popular tablet app marketplaces.\r\n\r\nArt and visual design for the game was developed by the team using Pixelmator for OS X and a graphics tablet, and a minimal amount of 3D modeling using Blender. The visual design of the game was inspired by the Energy Rating labels present on appliances in Australia.\r\n\r\nThe Energy rating data was initially analysed using R to confirm that the distribution of ratings and features across products lent themselves to both easy comparisons between products and game mechanics. Following he data massaging in R, the data was manipulated in spreadsheets before finally being exported to JSON for use in the game.\r\n\r\nGit, via GitHub, was used for source code management, and our code is available under the BSD license via our repository at https://github.com/admiraldolphin/govhack2013 \r\n\r\n\r\n# Tools/Languages Used\r\n* Google Drive – collaborative planning, designing, sorting and review of interesting data sets.\r\n* Unity – 3D development environment.\r\n* JavaScript – for game code.\r\n* C# – for game code.\r\n* Photoshop \r\n* JSON formatted data\r\n* Spreadsheets\r\n* Cintiq/graphics tablet\r\n* Pixelmator\r\n* Python – used for a web service to feed data to the game.\r\n* [R](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_(programming_language) – statistical computing language, used for confirming the data's viability for the game design.\r\n* Logic Pro – audio design for game.\r\n\r\n# Development Approach\r\n* Paper prototyping\r\n* Iterative development of base game engine whilst analysing datasets for in-game suitability.\r\n* Combining multiple datasets.\r\n\r\n# Data Sets\r\n* [Appliance Energy Ratings](http://opendata.linkdigital.com.au/dataset/appliance-energy-ratings) – energy usage and efficiency rating of common household appliances such as air conditioners.\r\n* [National Regional Profile](http://stat.abs.gov.au/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=NRP7#) - ABS data showing characteristics of regions and in comparing regions across Australia.\r\n* [Average Price for Australian Electricity](http://www.aemo.com.au/Electricity/Data/Price-and-Demand/Average-Price-Tables) - AEMO data on average electricity prices in Australia.\r\n\r\n# GovHack Categories\r\n* Best use of data.gov.au\r\n* Innovative pooling of ABS datasets with non-ABS datasets\r\n* Greatest Potential for Research Impact (Intersect)\r\n* Best of (General) \r\n* Best High Bandwidth Application for Digital Humanities\r\n* Innovative use of ABS\r\n* Best visual storytelling\r\n* National Beautiful Data Prize\r\n* Best Student Project\r\n* Spirit of GovHack\r\n* Most Aesthetically Awesome Hack\r\n\r\n# Miscellaneous\r\n* [Photos of GovHack 2013 in Hobart taken by the team](http://lab.to/gh2013pics)\r\n* [Team page of GovHack 2013 Hackerspace](http://hackerspace.govhack.org/?q=groups/marvellous-ultimate-appliances)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
