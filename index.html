<a name="overview" class="anchor" href="#overview"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Overview</h1>

<p>Marvellous Ultimate Appliance is an electronic card game designed to help raise awareness of the energy consumed by common household appliances. Drawing on the data provided by the E3 Program (<a href="http://www.energyrating.gov.au">http://www.energyrating.gov.au</a>), the game is inspired by popular battle card games such as “Magic: The Gathering”; the data is used to provide stats for cards, representing each appliance in the E3 Program database. </p>

<p>The key pieces of data used are the energy star rating, capacity, and running cost (derived from the kWh consumption per year). The project was conceived by the team after exploring the available datasets, as a way of making people more aware of the power consumption, energy usage, and cost-to-capacity implications of typical consumer appliances. The game is styled as a battle of appliances between neighbours, competing to spend their money on the largest, most efficient, and effective appliances. The dataset used was intriguing, because whilst extremely interesting, it was not presented in a way that made the team compelled to understand it, or make use of the knowledge it gave them. Therefore, this project presents components of the data in entertaining and highly compelling ways. It is hoped that this vivid presentation will inspire players of the game to learn and understand about their appliances, and how they impact energy usage and its flow-on effects. We made it into a game!</p>

<a name="technical-overview" class="anchor" href="#technical-overview"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Technical Overview</h1>

<p>The game was developed using a combination of C# and JavaScript, compiled through the Mono development environment in the Unity game engine. The game runs on the web, through the Unity browser plugin, as well as natively on Mac, Windows, and Linux. That said, the game was designed in the spirit of tablet computers such as the iPad; in future development, the team plans to polish the game and deploy it to the popular tablet app marketplaces.</p>

<p>Art and visual design for the game was developed by the team using Pixelmator for OS X and a graphics tablet, and a minimal amount of 3D modeling using Blender. The visual design of the game was inspired by the Energy Rating labels present on appliances in Australia.</p>

<p>The Energy rating data was initially analysed using R to confirm that the distribution of ratings and features across products lent themselves to both easy comparisons between products and game mechanics. Following the data massaging in R, the data was manipulated in spreadsheets before finally being exported to JSON for use in the game.</p>

<p>Git, via GitHub, was used for source code management, and our code is available under the BSD license via our repository at <a href="https://github.com/admiraldolphin/govhack2013">https://github.com/admiraldolphin/govhack2013</a> </p>

<a name="missing-features" class="anchor" href="#missing-features"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Missing Features</h1>

<ul>
<li>We wanted to (and even got the basics of) the data parsed to collect realtime electrical data costs and use this to influence the cost of appliances on a location by location basis.</li>
<li>We wanted to have people select their exact suburb and get given an income based on that suburbs average income.</li>
<li>We wanted to put in house upgrades such as solar panels or insulation that would improve the appliances or make them cheaper, the efficacy of the upgrades was going to be based on real world weather data from bom.gov.au</li>
</ul><h1>
<a name="next-steps" class="anchor" href="#next-steps"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Next Steps</h1>

<p>In addition to to implementing the missing features noted above, we plan to complete the game for the iPad (and other tablet platforms). We feel that the most appropriate platform for a game such as this is a tablet. Additionally, we'll be polishing the user experience, art, visual design, sound design, and use of data to optimise the gameplay experience and tune the game balance for optimal fun.</p>

<p><em>It's not Rocket Appliance!</em></p>

<h3>
<a name="phases" class="anchor" href="#phases"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Phases</h3>

<p>The game has 3 phases which represent a year of heavy appliance usage.
The phases are as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li>The Purchase</li>
<li>The Battle</li>
<li>The Update</li>
</ol><h4>
<a name="the-purchase-phase" class="anchor" href="#the-purchase-phase"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The Purchase Phase</h4>

<p>The Purchase Phase is the time to buy new Appliances and Extend your House. Both Players can buy any number of Appliances or House Extensions from the Store, assuming the can pay for them.</p>

<h4>
<a name="the-battle-phase" class="anchor" href="#the-battle-phase"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The Battle Phase</h4>

<p>The Battle Phase represents a year of hard back and forth whitegood combat and consists of two stages of attacings, defending and unflooping in the order shown below:</p>

<ol>
<li>Player 1 Attacks</li>
<li>Player 2 Defends</li>
<li>Player 2 Attacks</li>
<li>Player 1 Defends</li>
<li>Unfloop</li>
<li>Player 2 Attacks</li>
<li>Player 1 Defends</li>
<li>Player 1 Attacks</li>
<li>Player 2 Defends</li>
<li>Unfloop</li>
</ol><h5>
<a name="attack" class="anchor" href="#attack"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Attack</h5>

<p>In an Attack the Attacking Player chooses any number (including zero) unflooped Appliances and floops them. The total number of Energy Stas on the flooped Appliances is the attack value being dealt to the Defending Player.</p>

<h5>
<a name="defend" class="anchor" href="#defend"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Defend</h5>

<p>In a Defense the Defending Player chooses any number (including zero) unflooped Appliances and floops them. The total Capacity of the flooped Appliances is the defense value to stop the Attack. If the difference between the Attack and Defense is greater than zero, the Defending Player looses Money.</p>

<h5>
<a name="unfloop" class="anchor" href="#unfloop"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Unfloop</h5>

<p>In the unfloop stage, both players unfloop up to two flooped Appliances, showing their readiness to the continue the battle!</p>

<h5>
<a name="winning" class="anchor" href="#winning"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Winning</h5>

<p>When a Player is reduced to zero Money they have gone broke, and the other Player is declared the Winner!</p>

<h4>
<a name="update-phase" class="anchor" href="#update-phase"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Update Phase</h4>

<p>The Update Phase is when both Players regroup and prepare for another year of Appliance combat. In the Update Phase both Players decrease all Appliance Durability by one, any Appliance reduced to zero Durability has broken under wear and tear and is recycled and discarded. The Update Phase is when both Players recieve their income.</p>

<h3>
<a name="appliances" class="anchor" href="#appliances"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Appliances</h3>

<p>An Appliance is your primary tool in the war against your neighbour and has a Cost, Energy Star Rating, Capacity, Durability, Type and Name.</p>

<h4>
<a name="cost" class="anchor" href="#cost"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Cost</h4>

<p>Cost is how much an appliance costs to purchase and is based upon the real world running costs of the Appliance.</p>

<h4>
<a name="energy-star-rating" class="anchor" href="#energy-star-rating"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Energy Star Rating</h4>

<p>The Energy Star Rating is the Attack value of the Appliance, and is based upon the real world energy rating of the Appliance.</p>

<h4>
<a name="capacity" class="anchor" href="#capacity"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Capacity</h4>

<p>The Capacity of the Appliance is the Defense value of the Appliance and is based upon the real world capacity of the Appliance.</p>

<h4>
<a name="durability" class="anchor" href="#durability"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Durability</h4>

<p>Durability is how reliable the Appliance is, all Appliances break over time, should an Appliance be reduced to zero Durability it is recycled and thrown away.</p>

<h4>
<a name="type" class="anchor" href="#type"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Type</h4>

<p>The Type shows what kind of Appliance it is. An Appliance can only go into your House if there is space to support it. The different types are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Air Conditioners</li>
<li>Washing Machine</li>
<li>Clothes Drier</li>
<li>Dishwasher</li>
<li>Television</li>
<li>Refrigerator</li>
</ul><h4>
<a name="name" class="anchor" href="#name"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Name</h4>

<p>The Name tells you what your lovely Appliance is called and is based on the real world name of the Appliance.</p>

<h3>
<a name="house" class="anchor" href="#house"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>House</h3>

<p><em>It's not a house, it's a home!</em>
Your House is your fortress and base of operations in the war against your neighbour! Your House has a number of Application Slots and an Income.</p>

<h4>
<a name="appliance-slots" class="anchor" href="#appliance-slots"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Appliance Slots</h4>

<p>Appliance Slots show how big your House is and how many Appliances you can hold. Each slot has a Type which corresponds to the Appliance Type, so a TV can only go into a TV slot, a Dishwasher into a Dishwasher slot and so on.</p>

<h4>
<a name="upgarding-your-house" class="anchor" href="#upgarding-your-house"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Upgarding your House</h4>

<p>Sometimes your House just isn't big enough, from the Store you are able to buy an Extension to your House. The cost of the Extension is removed from your Money.</p>

<h4>
<a name="income" class="anchor" href="#income"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Income</h4>

<p>Income is how much extra Money you get at the end of each year in the Update Phase. Your Income is based on your starting location, with more affluent areas having a higher Income.</p>

<h3>
<a name="store" class="anchor" href="#store"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Store</h3>

<p>The Store is where you go to buy new Appliances or Extenstions to your House. The Store has a random selection of Appliances everytime you visit. The Store can only be visited during the Purchase Phase.</p>

<h3>
<a name="flooping" class="anchor" href="#flooping"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Flooping</h3>

<p>Flooping and Unflooping is how you show which Appliances are engaged. To Floop and Appliance rotate it 90 degrees and to Unfloop, rotate it back 90 degrees. A flooped Appliance can not be used until it is Unflooped.</p>
