<p>Marvellous Ultimate Appliance is an electronic card game designed to help raise awareness of the energy consumed by common household appliances. </p>

<a name="overview" class="anchor" href="#overview"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Overview</h1>

<p>Marvellous Ultimate Appliance is an electronic card game designed to help raise awareness of the energy consumed by common household appliances. Drawing on the data provided by the E3 Program (<a href="http://www.energyrating.gov.au">http://www.energyrating.gov.au</a>), the game is inspired by popular battle card games such as “Magic: The Gathering”; the data is used to provide stats for cards representing each appliance in the E3 Program database. </p>

<p>The key pieces of data used are the energy star rating, capacity, and running cost (derived from the kWh consumption per year). The project was conceived by the team after exploring the available datasets as a way of making people more aware of the power consumption, energy usage, and cost-to-capacity implications of typical consumer appliances. The game is styled as a battle of appliances between neighbours, competing to spend their money on the most largest, most efficient, and effective appliances. The dataset used was intriguing, because whilst extremely interesting, it was not presented in a way that made the team compelled to understand it, or make use of the knowledge it gave them. </p>

<p>The project presents components of the data in entertaining and highly compelling ways, with the hope that this vivid presentation would inspire players of the game to learn and understand about their appliances, and how they impact energy usage and its flow-on effects.</p>

<a name="technical-overview" class="anchor" href="#technical-overview"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Technical Overview</h1>

<p>The game was developed using a combination of C# and JavaScript (both compiled through the Mono development environment) in the Unity game engine. The game runs on the web, through the Unity browser plugin, as well as natively on Mac, Windows, and Linux. That said, the game was designed in the spirit of tablet computers such as the iPad; in future development, the team plans to polish the game and deploy it to the popular tablet app marketplaces.</p>

<p>Art and visual design for the game was developed by the team using Pixelmator for OS X and a graphics tablet, and a minimal amount of 3D modeling using Blender. The visual design of the game was inspired by the Energy Rating labels present on appliances in Australia.</p>

<p>The Energy rating data was initially analysed using R to confirm that the distribution of ratings and features across products lent themselves to both easy comparisons between products and game mechanics. Following he data massaging in R, the data was manipulated in spreadsheets before finally being exported to JSON for use in the game.</p>

<p>Git, via GitHub, was used for source code management, and our code is available under the BSD license via our repository at <a href="https://github.com/admiraldolphin/govhack2013">https://github.com/admiraldolphin/govhack2013</a> </p>
